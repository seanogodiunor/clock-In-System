# clock-In-System
clock-in platform designed for tracking attendance. It operates by storing restoration dates in a central database, ensuring that all records are accurately maintained and easily accessible.

When a new user attempts to access the system, they are first prompted to complete a registration process. This step involves entering their personal information and credentials, which are then securely stored in the database. Once registered, users can seamlessly clock in and out, with their attendance data automatically recorded.
